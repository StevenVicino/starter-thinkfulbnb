# Thinkfulbnb

Thinkfulbnb is a vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations in that locale. This app follows a mobile first approach to web development through the use of media queries and flexbox layouts.  This responsive website is not fully functional, but was used to showcase HTML and CSS.

For this assignment, you will implement Thinkfulbnb's landing page in HTML & CSS.
